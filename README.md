Assignment description here.

## Requirements

## Get started by syncing with Glitch!

First time? Need some extra help getting set up? Check out [this tutorial video on Kaltura](#).

**Import this repository to your Glitch account**
- Copy the URL of this repository, then open [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) in a new tab.
- Click "New Project", then "Import from Github".
- Paste the URL of this repository into the dialog.

A new Glitch project with this code will appear! Now, you should set up the export so that when you're done editing in Glitch, Github will be able to see your changes, and you can check to see if you met the assignment requirements. Now is a good time to test that connection.

**Export your changes from Glitch to Gibhub**
- Click "Tools" at the bottom of the page, and then click "Import and Export".
- Click "Export to Github".
- Return to this tab and grab your repository name. For example, `ProfessorKolodziej/example-assignment`.
- You're ready to work! When you're happy with what you have, export your changes, and then return to Github and check the Pull Requests tab to see a new branch from Glitch. Your grading and feedback will be here!

## How grading and feedback works

This repository uses Autograding to check the basic assignment requirements. Once you pass these requirements, send me a link to the pull request in Blackboard. I'll give you additional feedback on things like performance and coding style, so you know how to improve your code for next time.

## Development

If you'd like to run this project locally, [install the LTS version of node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), clone the repo and then:

1. `npm install` to install dependencies
2. `npm start` to preview the app locally
3. `npm test` to run the tests

## About this repository

Automated feedback is heavily based on the work of [thawkin3](https://github.com/thawkin3/dom-testing-demo), and uses Jest.
